Readme

Coded up Drupal 7 theme based on Open Charity design. 

Used Photoshop to slice up a few of the images I used, but for the most part its use was minimal. There are a few variations from the original design, such as font-types used, or exact placement of some of the divs. However nothing that is too off.

There are 4 media-queries I included at various browser sizes. For the most part I tinkered with the blog section mostly, but did have to work with the other areas to accomodate smaller browser sizes. 

I did not include a generic content page (that would be linked to from the blog posts). I did not use a pre-processor like SASS either, although I am familiar with it.
